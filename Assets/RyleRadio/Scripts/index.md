### <i>This is the source documentation. If you want usage documentation or guides, go to the <b>[user documentation](https://ryle-e.github.io/ryle-radio-docs/)!

**Ryle Radio** is an open-source "radio" system for Unity that allows you to create tracks of different kinds and pan between them at runtime. It includes broadcasters and insulators as spatial components, as well as code-free interactions and interfacing :)

This is the code documentation for the package, which has all members, methods, properties, etc documented. This is my first time making public documentation like this- let alone for an open-source package.

You should probably start at \ref RadioData and \ref RadioOutput - these are sort of the central scripts of the whole system and tie back into most other scripts used throughout this package. Feel free to go through whatever- the source code should be fully commented too.

If you have any questions, issues, or anything really, contact me at rjdwalrus@gmail.com :)
